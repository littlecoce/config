Shades-of-gray is a dark GTK-theme with ergonomic contrasts. It supports Gnome, Cinnamon, Xfce4, Mate and Openbox. Theme customizations for Firefox, Thunderbird and Inkscape are additionally included. Shades-of-gray is available in seven color variants:

• Gray
• Arch
• Cerulean
• Firebrick
• Harvest
• Orient
• Patina


Installation:

Extract and copy the chosen theme folders either for personal use into directory ~/.themes/ or for common use into /usr/share/themes/.

Arch Linux: You can install the AUR package gtk-theme-shades-of-gray:

    https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gtk-theme-shades-of-gray


Customizations:

Each theme folder contains an app-gadgets directory with additional theme files for Thunderbird, Firefox and Inkspape.


Thunderbird:

The folder "assets" and the file "userChrome.css" in folder "Thunderbird-Shades-of-gray" contain a Thunderbird theme adapted to Shades of gray. Copy both to this location:

    ~/.thunderbird/<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/assets
    ~/.thunderbird/<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/userChrome.css


Lightning uses its own bright colors in default setting. The option for using the theme colors is hidden as "Accessibility". Open the Thunderbird settings and activate the checkbox "Optimize colors for accesibility" in calendar area.

If you change a Shades-of-gray theme color, it is not necessary to copy the file again. You can simply comment out the current theme color in "userChrome.css" (Thunderbird and Firefox) and comment in the new theme color value.


Firefox:

The file userChrome.css in folder Firefox-Shades-of-gray contains a theme adaption to Shades-of-gray. To enable the customizations, copy the file or its content to this location:

    ~/.mozilla/firefox/<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/userChrome.css

Firefox uses widgets of the current GTK3 theme in websites that have not designed their own widgets for forms. With dark themes this is ugly and input fields, checkboxes etc. are difficult to use (e.g. black font in dark input fields). To fix this behavior the file userContent.css contains color-neutral form widgets. This file also contains theme customizations for the New Tab page (about:newtab).

Copy the file or its contents to this location for enabling:

    ~/.mozilla/firefox/<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/userContent.css

The file bookmark-search-plus-2.css contains theme customizations for the very useful add-on "Bookmark search plus 2":

    https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bookmark-search-plus-2

Copy this file into your chrome directory:

    ~/.mozilla/firefox/<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/bookmark-search-plus-2.css

Note: You should choose the dark style in Firefox to get a consistent dark appearance.


Inkscape:

Original colored icons in Inkscape are hard to identify in dark themes. The file icon.svg in folder Inkscape-icons contains bright icons. To use them in Inkscape, the file must be stored in this directory:

    ~/.config/inkscape/icons/icons.svg


Requirements:

• GTK+ 3.20 or above
• Pixmap theme engine
• Murrine theme engine
